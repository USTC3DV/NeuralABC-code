We proposed Neural-ABC, a novel parametric model based on neural implicit functions that can represent clothed human bodies with disentangled latent spaces for identity, clothing, shape, and pose. 

## Pipeline
Neural-ABC is a neural implicit parametric model with latent spaces of human identity, clothing, shape and pose. 
It can generate various human identities and different clothes. 
The clothed human body can deform into different body shapes and poses.
